## Overview

The main goal of the field of AI since its inception has been to create human-like artificial intelligence.
However, Chollet, argues that has not being possible given that there is no clear definition of intelligence,
neither an standard way to measure it.

In this context, he proposes a new formal definition of intelligence, based on *Algorithmic Information Theory* (AIT),
and proposes a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Following this, he proposes a new
benchmark: the *Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus* (ARC), and explains how it can be used to evaluate artificial *fluid*
intelligence.
