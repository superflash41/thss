# Thesis Overview
Since its conception in the 1950s, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has pursued the development of systems that not only perform specific tasks but are also capable of understanding, learning, and reasoning in a generalized way, mimicking the versatility of human intelligence. This form of AI, commonly referred to as *artificial general intelligence* (AGI), is expected to demonstrate reasoning abilities and an understanding of abstractions that can be transferred across different domains of knowledge.

Although this aspiration has remained latent, todayâ€™s reality presents both significant progress and limitations. In recent years, neural network-based models have proven highly effective in pattern recognition tasks, such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, their effectiveness has been constrained by the need for large volumes of training data, and their difficulty in solving problems that involve abstract reasoning and generalization from few examples.

This gap between the current performance of AI systems and the capabilities that characterize a more general intelligence has driven the exploration of alternative approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning mechanisms, which align more closely with human cognitive processes. In this context, the benchmark *Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence* ([ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/)) has emerged as a key reference for evaluating such capabilities, as it proposes problems that require abstract understanding, extrapolation, and problem-solving from limited examples. However, despite recent advances, even large-scale models such as O3 and O4-Mini have not been able to fully solve the benchmark. Their purely neural approach has proven to be inefficient in terms of computational resources, highlighting the need for more efficient solutions.

This research proposes the development of a neuro-symbolic alternative based on lightweight neural models and efficient symbolic representation techniques, with the goal of tackling the ARC-AGI benchmark.
