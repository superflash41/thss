<ul>
<li>
<p>The main goal of the AI field since its inception has been to create human-like artificial
intelligence. However, Chollet argues that this goal has not been possible to achieve given that there
is no clear definition of intelligence, neither a standard way to measure it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this context, he proposes a <strong>formal definition of intelligence</strong>, and a set of guidelines on <strong>how
a general AI benchmark should look like</strong>. Following this, he introduces the <em>Abstraction and Reasoning
Corpus</em> (ARC) as a tool to evaluate artificial <em>fluid</em> intelligence.</p>

  1.1 Need for an actionable definition and measure of intelligence
  <a class="anchor" href="#11-need-for-an-actionable-definition-and-measure-of-intelligence">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have been able to engineer systems that excel a specific tasks, but they still have limitations
regarding their capacity to work with little data, or on repurposing themselves to deal with novel
situations for which they were not trained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The problem behind this is that we do not have a clear definition of what intelligence is, even when
the field has already some 70 years of history. With no clear definition, there is no a goal to pursue.
Even worse, there is no a established standard way to measure it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, it becomes obvious that we need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear definition of intelligence that is actionable, explanatory and <strong>measurable</strong>.</li>
<li>A standard and reliable way to measure it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some guilt resides on the AI community itself, as it has constantly been ignoring the efforts of
establishing comprehensive and formal definitions and evaluation methods. To Chollet, this is a
mistake. In this paper, he will point out the implicit assumptions on which the field has been working,
and attempt to correct most of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="12-defining-intelligence-two-divergent-visions">
  1.2 Defining intelligence: two divergent visions
  <a class="anchor" href="#12-defining-intelligence-two-divergent-visions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We must start then analyzing the current state of the field. In the context of AI research, Legg and
Hutter (2007) summarized 70 definitions into: &ldquo;Intelligence measures an agent&rsquo;s ability to achieve
goals in a wide range of environments&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this definition, we can extract two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>to achieve goals</em>: task-specific skill</li>
<li><em>in a wide range of environments</em>: capability of generalization and adaptation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implicit in the second one, is the fact that an agent needs to be able to learn to handle new tasks
(skill acquisition) for it to truly achieve generality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two components of that definition, map themselves to the two main views of the human&rsquo;s mind
nature: one view considers the mind as a static assembly of special-purpose mechanisms developed
through evolution, and set to only learn what it was programmed to, and another view in which
the mind is a blank slate (Tabula Rasa) capable of turning experience into knowledge and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must then start analyzing these perspectives before we can formulate our own definition.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Originated in Darwin (1859), this view considers the mind as a collection of special-purpose
adaptations developed by humans to solve specific problems they faced during evolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the AI community, this view srved as a base for the development of their own definition</p>
